I would like to create a polish calendar app. The app would say the day, date, month, and month. In polish words, in phonetics, and in English. There would be a calendar based on polish calendars starting on Sundays. The calendar would show a monthly view with the month and year at the top. The user would be able to scroll through the calendar to select a date. The calendar should highlight national holidays and days of significance to Poland. The user would be able listen to the phrase repeatedly if desired. There would be a button to select if the year was to be repeated. English/polish toggle to change the language of the interface. The app would follow the light or dark mode already set on the device. The app would have a cultural page which would explain the derivation of the polish names used for days and months, and explain the significance of holidays when a particular date was selected. The app would be called learn polish dates, and would have an appropriate theme. The app interface would be designed to fit on a smartphone screen. The app would be split into as main sections as necessary. There would be a cultural.js which would hold the cultural data. A year.js which would handle how years are  presented (from 0AD to 3000AD). There would be a holiday.js to handle holiday calculations, including Easter.
